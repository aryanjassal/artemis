# Welcome to DOS2B

DOS2B is an operating system that I am currently working on. It is meant to replicate the function of the legacy MS-DOS operating systems. This will not be an accurate recreation as I will be adding some touches here and there myself. This project is meant as a hobby project that I'm doing for fun. I'm also learning the ins-and-outs of a computer this way.

## How do I run this?

To run the operating system, you need to first clone this repository. Then, run the following command in the same directory where the `Makefile` is located. Please note that you need to have the `qemu` and `nasm` packages installed in order to run this operating system.
  
```bash
make
```

And that's it! This should compile the operating system and open up a QEMU window with the operating system.
